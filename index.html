        <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;">Transform your smile and facial structure with orthodontic treatment</p>
    </header>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Braces don't just line up your teeth. They can change how you look—and how you feel. Thinking about getting braces for yourself or your child? You're probably wondering what kind of transformation to expect. The answer? A pretty big one.</p>
        
        <p>Let's go through the changes step by step. From what happens before the braces go on, to how your smile and face can shift during treatment. And when it's all done, how something like teeth whitening can make that fresh, new smile really shine.</p>
        
        <div class="callout">
            Braces transform more than just your teeth - they can enhance your entire facial structure and boost your confidence
        </div>

        <h2>What Happens Before Braces?</h2>
        <p>Before any brackets or wires show up, there's some planning involved. Your orthodontist needs to see what's going on in your mouth. It's more than just looking at crooked teeth—it's about getting the full picture.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1 – Consultation and Evaluation</h3>
        <p>This first step is like a deep dive into your teeth and bite. The orthodontist will take X-rays, photos, and impressions. They're checking for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crowded or twisted teeth</li>
            <li>Gaps between teeth</li>
            <li>Overbite, underbite, or crossbite</li>
            <li>Any jaw alignment issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This step helps map out the plan for how to get your teeth where they need to go.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 2 – Prepping for Braces</h3>
        <p>Once there's a plan, it's time to get ready. Sometimes that means a dental cleaning. Other times, a few teeth might need to come out if there's not enough space. This gives your braces room to work.</p>
        
        <h2>The Big Shift – Changes After Braces</h2>
        <p>Here's where the magic happens. Braces don't just make your teeth straight. They fix your bite and even shift the way your face looks.</p>
        
        <h3>Straighter Teeth</h3>
        <p>This is the part most people expect. Braces move your teeth slowly and gently. What you'll notice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gaps start to close</li>
            <li>Crowding disappears</li>
            <li>Your smile looks neat and balanced</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Better Bite</h3>
        <p>A good bite means your teeth come together the right way. That's just as important as straight teeth. Fixing your bite helps with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Easier chewing and speaking</li>
            <li>Less jaw tension or pain</li>
            <li>Healthier teeth over time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Braces fix overbites, underbites, and more—bringing balance to your whole mouth.</p>
        
        <h3>Facial Changes</h3>
        <p>This might surprise you. Braces can reshape your face—especially around the mouth and jaw.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <h4>Jawline Definition</h4>
            <p>When your bite lines up properly, your jaw may look more even. That means a clearer jawline and stronger chin.</p>
            
            <h4>Cheekbone Enhancement</h4>
            <p>Once your teeth are back where they belong, your cheeks might look fuller. Your face could seem more balanced overall.</p>
            
            <h4>Lip Positioning</h4>
            <p>Lips rest differently when the teeth behind them are in the right place. No more teeth pushing them out—or pulling them too far in.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>And here's something cool—kids and teens tend to see the biggest changes since their bones are still growing. But even adults can notice a real difference.</p>
        
        <h2>Real Results: Before and After Braces</h2>
        <p>Seeing the changes in others can be really motivating. The <b><a href="https://cypresstownedental.com/before-and-after-braces/"> before and after braces </a></b> difference? It's no small thing.</p>
        
        <div class="before-after-container">
            <div class="before-after before">
                <h3>Before Braces</h3>
                <p>This is what most people start with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Crooked or tilted teeth</li>
                    <li>Gaps and crowding</li>
                    <li>Deep overbite or jaw issues</li>
                    <li>Smiles that feel "off"</li>
                    <li>Facial asymmetry</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="before-after after">
                <h3>After Braces</h3>
                <p>Now comes the fun part. After treatment, people often see:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Straight, evenly spaced teeth</li>
                    <li>A bite that works well</li>
                    <li>Balanced facial features</li>
                    <li>A bigger, happier smile</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>Look at photos taken before and after braces and you'll often see someone who looks more confident—and sometimes even younger.</p>
        
        <h2>How Long Do Braces Take to Work?</h2>
        <p>The time it takes to straighten teeth depends on what needs fixing. Here's a general idea:</p>
        
        <table class="treatment-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Problem</th>
                <th>Time Frame</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Minor crowding or gaps</td>
                <td>6 to 12 months</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Moderate issues</td>
                <td>12 to 18 months</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Major bite correction</td>
                <td>18 to 24+ months</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>Once braces come off, retainers help keep everything in place. Skipping your retainer can undo all that progress.</p>
        
        <h2>Finishing Touch: Teeth Whitening After Braces</h2>
        <p>After braces, your teeth are in line—but they might not be shining yet. That's where  <b><a href="http://cypresstownedental.com/cosmetic-dentistry/teeth-whitening/"> teeth whitening</a></b> comes in. It's the boost your new smile needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Whiten After Braces?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Removes small stains left by brackets</li>
            <li>Brightens the full smile</li>
            <li>Makes those straight teeth really stand out</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Best Whitening Choices After Braces</h3>
        <h4>In-Office Whitening</h4>
        <p>This is the fastest way. It only takes about an hour, and the results are noticeable right away.</p>
        
        <h4>Custom At-Home Kits</h4>
        <p>Dentists can make trays just for your teeth. You use them at home, at your own pace, for safe and strong results.</p>
        
        <h4>Whitening Toothpaste</h4>
        <p>Helpful for upkeep, but won't handle deeper stains.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Wait a few weeks after getting your braces off before whitening. Your teeth can be sensitive at first, and this gives them time to settle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Keeping That Smile Looking Great</h2>
        <p>You worked hard for that smile. Let's make sure it stays awesome.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Wear Your Retainer:</strong> Your retainer keeps your teeth from drifting back. It's not optional—it's essential.</li>
            <li><strong>Brush and Floss Every Day:</strong> Keep your teeth clean and strong. A soft-bristled toothbrush and floss (or a water flosser) make it easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Visit Your Dentist Regularly:</strong> Checkups help catch any shifting early. Plus, your dentist can recommend whitening if needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Mindful of What You Eat:</strong> Skip the super hard, sticky, or sugary foods. They can damage enamel or lead to cavities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Before and After Braces – A Real Change</h2>
        <p>Braces aren't just about looks. Sure, the before and after braces results are amazing visually. But they also help you chew, talk, and smile better. Many people say their whole face feels more in balance afterward.</p>
        
        <p>And when you top it off with teeth whitening, that smile looks even brighter.</p>
        
        <div class="callout">
            <h3>Thinking About Braces?</h3>
            <p>If you've been thinking about fixing your teeth, now's a great time. Talk to an orthodontist near you. They'll help you create a plan that fits your needs. And don't forget—when the braces come off, follow up with whitening to really finish the look.</p>
            <p>A straighter bite. A cleaner smile. A big confidence boost. That's what braces can do.</p>
